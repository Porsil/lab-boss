# <h1 align="center">**LAB BOSS**</h1>

## Introduction

Lab Boss is a laboratory planning tool and can be used by any laboratory team to make managing the workload easy and stress free. Lab Boss contains two apps, a batch tracker app and a scheduler app.

The batch tracker app allows the laboratory to track batches through the laboratory, easily seeing what batches require testing, when they are due and if they are a priority for the business.

The scheduler app allows the laboratory to schedule the workload by quickly and easily assigning an analytical test to an analyst on a particular day.

## Agile Methodology

An agile approach was implemented for the project using GitHub projects where the Epics were added as Milestones and allocated the User Stories as Issues. Each User Story Issue was given acceptance criteria and tasks to assist in the completion of each Issue.

The project board was also used to track development tasks and backlog issues (PBIs).

The project board can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/Porsil/projects/6)

## Design

The site was designed to have a simple and professional look. The site was designed to have a clean and clinical look as the site would be used inside a laboratory setting.

### Fonts

Manrope was used as the font for the body of the site and Russo One was used for the headings. In case the fonts do not import into the website correctly, Sans Serif was used as the backup font.

### Colour Scheme

The colours for the site were taken from the logo using the Google Chrome Eye Dropper extension:

### Imagery

To keep the site looking professional, only one image was used on the pages that did not contain much text. The image used is of test tubes containing a blue liquid to keep in theme of the site.
