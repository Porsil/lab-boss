![Responsive Mockup](readme_assets/responsiveness.png)

## Introduction

Lab Boss is a laboratory planning tool and can be used by any laboratory team to make managing the workload easy and stress free. Lab Boss contains two apps, a batch tracker app and a scheduler app.

The batch tracker app allows the laboratory to track batches through the laboratory, easily seeing what batches require testing, when they are due and if they are a priority for the business.

The scheduler app allows the laboratory to schedule the workload by quickly and easily assigning an analytical test to an analyst on a particular day.

## Data Model

Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views  and Object-Oriented Programming princliples were used throughout this project.

Custom models were generated for this project:

Tracker app:
- The material model is used to create a custom list of the different materials or products the laboratory tests.
- The batch model is used to create details of a specific batch that has been received in the laboratory for testing. It uses the material model as a foreign key as a particular batch can only have 1 material.

Scheduler:
- The analyst model is used to create a custom list of analyst who perform testing in the laboratory. The user model was not used as not all users would be performing testing e.g. managers.
- The test model is used to create a custom list of testing that is performed in the laboratory.
- The workload model used both the analyst and test model and foreign keys to produce workload cards. These are designed to inform the analysts what tests they are performing on a certain day. 

Django AllAuth was used for the user authentication system.

## Agile Methodology

An agile approach was implemented for the project using GitHub projects where the Epics were added as Milestones and allocated the User Stories as Issues. Each User Story Issue was given acceptance criteria and tasks to assist in the completion of each Issue.

The project board was also used to track development tasks and backlog issues (PBIs).

The project board can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/Porsil/projects/6)

## Design

The site was designed to have a simple and professional look. The site was designed to have a clean and clinical look as the site would be used inside a laboratory setting.

### Fonts

Manrope was used as the font for the body of the site and Russo One was used for the headings. In case the fonts do not import into the website correctly, Sans Serif was used as the backup font.

### Colour Scheme

The colours for the site were taken from the logo using the Google Chrome Eye Dropper extension:

![Colour Palette](readme_assets/colour_palette.png)

### Imagery

To keep the site looking professional, only one image was used on the pages that did not contain much text. The image used is of test tubes containing a blue liquid to keep in theme of the site.

## Security

### User Access and Authentication

Two User group's were set up using the Django Administration Panel, Analyst and Senior Analyst, these groups were assigned permissions appropriate to the role.

The site makes use of these Admin User Groups along with Django's Admin LoginRequiredMixin and PermissionRequiredMixin to ensure user's can only see and use features appropriate to their role.

New user's are not able to see or access the site feature's until they have been assigned to a role by a senior analyst, and are informed of this upon registration.

If the user attemps to access a feature not apropriate to their role, they are shown a HTTP 403 Forbidden Error.

### Secret Keys

To prevent unwanted connections the DATABASR_URL, SECRET_KEY and CLOUDINARY_URL are stored in the env.py, which is listed in the .gitignore file. This was done before the initial commit to GitHub.

### Forms

To prevent attack, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens are used on all forms in the site.
