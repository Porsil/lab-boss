## Introduction

Lab Boss is a laboratory planning tool and can be used by any laboratory team to make managing the workload easy and stress free. Lab Boss contains two apps, a batch tracker app and a scheduler app.

The batch tracker app allows the laboratory to track batches through the laboratory, easily seeing what batches require testing, when they are due and if they are a priority for the business.

The scheduler app allows the laboratory to schedule the worklod by quickly and easily assigning an analytical test to an analyst on a particular day.
